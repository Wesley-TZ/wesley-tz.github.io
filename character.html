			<p class="chara-desc">17 years old (High school, 2nd year)<br>
                A former student of The Academy, an advanced school in the big city for only the brightest of students. After being forced out, he finds himself living back in the tiny coastal town his grandmother called home.<br>
                Having lost his mother and his leg at a young age in an accident, he finds himself stricken with terror when forced into dark, silent spaces.<br>
                In order to obtain the money for an advanced cybernetic leg, he buys into a plan to salvage a hidden treasure from his grandmother's sunken storehouse.</p>

                A robot girl salvaged from the bottom of the ocean by Natsuki.<br>
                Despite being a robot, her appearance and her ability to express emotion makes her near-indistinguishable from a normal human being.<br>
                It seems like she served as Natsuki's grandmother's assistant in the past, but she has almost no memory of the time before her long sleep beneath the sea. She asks Natsuki for help restoring her lost memories, such that she can fulfill her former master's last order.<br>
                Extremely curious and eager to learn, she prides herself on being 'high-performance.'</p>
